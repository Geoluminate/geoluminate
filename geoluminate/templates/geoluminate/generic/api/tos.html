  <div class="mt-3">
    <p>
      Thank you for using {{ geoluminate.database.name }} API (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the Service.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-4">1. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided to facilitate access to a global research database in accordance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usage of the Service is open to both commercial and non-academic entities, including but not limited to researchers, businesses, and individuals. However, we reserve the right to provide preferential access to researchers and database contributors in order to promote research collaboration and support the research community.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using the API and the data accessed through it, you must provide appropriate attribution, indicating that the API and data are licensed under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0)</a>. You must also indicate if changes were made to the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe in fostering a collaborative research environment and appreciate your understanding and cooperation in maintaining the integrity of the research database and the broader research community.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-4">2. Fair Usage and Resource Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      While we strive to provide open access to the research database, the Service is hosted on a server with limited computing capacity. Excessive or abusive usage of the Service, such as sending a large volume of requests in a short period of time, could impact the performance and availability of the Service for other users.
    </p>
    <p>
      To ensure fair usage and equitable access to the Service, we may implement rate limiting or access controls to prevent any single user or entity from overwhelming the server's resources. Users who wish to access the database at a higher rate than the standard limits should contact us to discuss potential solutions.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-4">3. Data Privacy and Security</h2>
    <p>
      By using the Service, you acknowledge that the data accessed through the API is subject to privacy and security considerations. You agree to handle any data obtained through the Service in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and you will not use the data in any manner that violates individual privacy or confidentiality.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-4">4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      The content and data accessible through the Service are protected by copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights. The API itself is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0). Any data accessed through the API that does not have specific licensing information attached to it is also released under the CC BY 4.0 license.
    </p>
    <p>
      While individual data objects within the API may contain specific licensing terms, these terms are required to be open source compliant to ensure that the data can be accessed and used freely for legitimate research purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree to use the data only for the purposes of legitimate research and will not reproduce, distribute, modify, or create derivative works based on the data in a manner that violates the terms of the relevant licenses or applicable laws.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-4">5. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, without prior notice, if we believe that your usage violates these Terms or the terms of any applicable licenses, or if it poses a threat to the integrity, availability, or security of the database or the Service.
    </p>
    <h2 class="mt-4">6. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in the Service or applicable laws. Any changes will be posted on this page, and your continued use of the Service after such changes will constitute your acceptance of the updated Terms.
    </p>
